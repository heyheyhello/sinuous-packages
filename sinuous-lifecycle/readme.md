# Sinuous onAttach/onDetach DOM lifecycles

Write lifecycles in Sinuous:

```tsx
import { h, observable } from 'sinuous';
import { hooks } from '../hooks.js'; // Explained below

const YourComponent = () => {
  const windowSize = observable('');
  const onWindowResize = () =>
    windowSize(`${window.innerWidth}px Ã— ${window.innerHeight}px`);

  hooks.onAttach(() => {
    onWindowResize();
    window.addEventListener('resize', onWindowResize);
  });
  hooks.onDetach(() => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', onWindowResize);
  });
  return <p>The window's size is <span>{windowSize}</span></p>;
};
```

UI libraries that work with the DOM instead of a virtual DOM often don't have a
centralized render loop to know when a component [`isConnected`][1]. Instead,
often a [`MutationObserver`][2] is used for these events as seen in packages
like [disconnected][3] and [disco][4]; written for hyperHTML and Sinuous,
respectively.

This works, but has very questionable performance and the API isn't personally
as intuitive as say, React's `componentWillMount`. Even without knowing the
browser's implementation, it sounds expensive to ask to observe _all_ `document`
changes. Instead, this package does the bookkeeping necessary to provide
lifecycles without a `MutationObserver`.

In `sinuous-trace`, internal Sinuous API calls are wrapped to track component
element creation, adoption, and removal. This is stored in a `WeakMap` tree
following all component relations. This means `sinuous-lifecycle` can plug into
those events and check whether the parent/child will change their connection to
the DOM, providing the onAttach/onDetach lifecycles.

## Setup

You extend the Sinuous API yourself when initializing your application. This is
explained in the Sinuous [internal API documentation][5]

Here's how to setup Sinuous for tracing and lifecycles. Run this before using
any Sinuous calls:

```ts
import { api } from 'sinuous'; // 'sinuous/h' if using JSX
import { trace } from 'sinuous-trace';
import { lifecyclePlugin } from 'sinuous-lifecycle';
import { logTrace } from 'sinuous-trace/log';
import { logLifecycle } from 'sinuous-lifecycle/log';

const tracers = trace.setup(api);
// This wires up onAttach/onDetach to run automatically
lifecyclePlugin(api, tracers);

// Optional logging to browser console. Notable performance hit but helpful
logTrace(api, tracers);
logLifecycle(lifecyclePlugin);

// Export lifecycle setters however you like
// Alternatively write directly to the Sinuous API as `api.hooks = {...}`
export const hooks = {
  onAttach(callback: () => void): void {
    lifecyclePlugin.setLifecycle('onAttach', callback);
  },
  onDetach(callback: () => void): void {
    lifecyclePlugin.setLifecycle('onDetach', callback);
  },
  // Any of your custom lifecycles...
};
```

Note that only onAttach/onDetach run automatically - you'll have to call the
provided `lifecyclePlugin.callTree()` as needed.

## Limitations

This works through bookkeeping. The internal Sinuous API has its execution
traced to determine what action to take. _This means you have to use Sinuous_.
In `MutationObserver`, you can  run DOM APIs directly (i.e `appendChild()`) or
mix and match libraries like using jQuery now and then.

_This won't work in this library. You must use the Sinuous API_. If you use
Sinuous for all of your UI you'll be fine. If you ever need to use a DOM API for
adding or removing nodes, use `api.add()` or `api.rm()` instead.

For instance, Sinuous documentation uses `document.appendChild()` as an example
of how to attach your root app to the DOM. Doing this won't cause lifecycles to
run. Instead, either:

**Call lifecycle tree manually:**

```tsx
const renderedApp = <App/>
document.appendChild(document.querySelector('#root'), renderedApp)
lifecyclePlugin.callTree('onAttach', renderedApp);
```

**Use `api.add()`**

```tsx
api.add(document.querySelector('#root'), <App/>)
```
